<h2>About 6-Disc Changer</h2>

<p>
    The 6-Disc Changer is a nostalgic tribute to the CD changers of the 90s and early 2000s, 
    reimagined for the digital streaming age.
</p>

<h3>What is a 6-Disc Changer?</h3>
<p>
    Back in the day, a 6-disc CD changer was a premium feature in home and car audio systems. 
    It allowed music enthusiasts to load multiple CDs at once and switch between them without 
    the hassle of physically changing discs each time.
</p>

<h3>Our Vision</h3>
<p>
    While streaming services like Spotify have revolutionized how we access music, they've also 
    changed how we experience albums. The 6-Disc Changer app brings back the intentional, 
    album-focused listening experience that many music lovers miss.
</p>

<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>
    With 6-Disc Changer, you can:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Select up to 6 albums from your Spotify library</li>
    <li>Switch between albums like changing discs</li>
    <li>Enjoy full album experiences rather than shuffled playlists</li>
    <li>Use familiar controls inspired by classic CD players</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>
    This application is built using:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Rust with the Axum web framework</li>
    <li>MiniJinja for HTML templating</li>
    <li>HTMX for interactive user experience</li>
    <li>SQLite database for storage</li>
</ul>
