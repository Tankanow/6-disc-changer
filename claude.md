# 6-Disc Changer - Claude Integration Guide

## Overview

This document provides information about how Claude AI has been integrated into the 6-Disc Changer project, a Rust application that transforms Spotify into a virtual 6-disc CD changer for an album-centric listening experience.

## Claude's Role in Development

Claude has assisted with:

- Project planning and architecture design
- Code generation and optimization
- Documentation creation
- Problem-solving and debugging
- Feature suggestions and implementation strategies

## Technology Stack

The 6-Disc Changer application uses:

- **Backend**: Rust with Axum framework
- **Templating**: MiniJinja
- **Frontend Interactivity**: HTMX
- **Database**: SQLite with Rust sqlx crate
- **Deployment**: fly.io

## Development Workflow with Claude

When working with Claude on this project:

1. **Planning**: Discuss high-level features and architecture
2. **Implementation**: Get assistance with code generation and optimization
3. **Testing**: Collaborate on test strategies and debugging
4. **Documentation**: Generate and refine documentation

### Instructions for Development
1. Ensure we are on a branch before changing any code. We should never be changing code on `main`.
2. Use `git` and Conventional Commits for commit messages.
3. Follow Rust's style guide for code formatting.

## Best Practices for Claude Collaboration

- Provide clear context when asking for assistance
- Share error messages and logs for debugging help
- Be specific about desired outcomes
- Use iterative feedback to refine Claude's outputs

## Future Development

Claude can assist with the following planned features:

- Spotify API integration
- Album selection interface
- Disc switching functionality
- Track controls (skip, play, pause)
- User authentication
- Album metadata display
- Playlist management

## Contributing

When contributing to this project with Claude's assistance:

1. Follow the project's coding standards
2. Document any AI-generated code appropriately
3. Test thoroughly before submitting changes
4. Provide clear commit messages explaining changes
